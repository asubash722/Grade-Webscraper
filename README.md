# Grade_Webscraper
In my school's grade portal, only your rounded average in a subject is displayed. If you had an 89.49 in the class, it would only display that you were at an 89, while if you were
at an 89.51, it would display a 90. This lack of detail was problematic especially when trying to determine how close I was to a specific letter grade, and if I wanted to know my
unrounded average, I would have to log into the portal and calculate it myself every single time. This grew very tiresome very quickly. So, I made this webscraper to automate this
process for me. I simply have to input my portal credentials and the subject that I want the program to calculate the unrounded average of, and it will log in to the portal,
select the subject, and compute my average in the course using the designated weightages in each category of the gradebook.
